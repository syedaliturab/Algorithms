Question - Given two integers A and B, find the greatest possible positive integer M, such that A % M = B % M.
Solution-

 If A % M = B % M, then:

 A ≡ B (mod M)

 This equivalence can be rewritten as:

 A - B ≡ 0 (mod M)

 Conclusion:
 This means that M must divide A - B. The largest possible value of M is the absolute difference:

 M = |A - B|

 Why?
 The divisors of |A - B| include all possible values of M that satisfy the condition A % M = B % M. The greatest such M is |A - B|, as it is the largest number dividing A - B.
