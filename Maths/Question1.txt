Quetion-
You are given a number A and a number B. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all numbers between A and B inclusive is taken (GCD(A, A+1, A+2 ... B)).
As this problem looks a bit easy, it is given that numbers A and B can be in the range of 10100.
You have to return the value of GCD found.
Solution-
GCD of consecutive number is always 1.
